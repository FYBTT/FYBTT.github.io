I"X<p>iostat命令是报告cpu的统计信息和磁盘的i/o统计信息。iostat命令通过观察存储设备实际的工作时间和它们的平均传输率来监控系统的i/o负载。
这个不需要root权限，数据来源可以直接通过访问procfs获取。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Device:
        This column gives the device (or partition) name, which is displayed as hdiskn with 2.2
        kernels, for the nth device. It is displayed as devm-n with 2.4 kernels, where m is the
        major number of the device, and n a distinctive number.  With newer kernels, the device
        name as listed in the /dev directory is displayed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>tps        Indicate the number of transfers per second that were issued to the device. A  transfer        is  an I/O request to the device. Multiple logical requests can be combined into a sin-
        gle I/O request to the device. A transfer is of indeterminate size.
